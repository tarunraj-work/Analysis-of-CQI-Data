# Analysis-of-CQI-Data
My undergraduate thesis. Coffee professionals are well aware of how much effort goes into providing a single cup of coffee to a consumer. Billions of dollars worth of unprocessed and unroasted coffee beans (green coffee) is imported just to the US every year. Each of these 26.2 million bags of coffee is usually picked, processed, and reviewed by hand. Aiding in the review process is a small society of licensed coffee-tasting experts called Q-Graders. These "coffee sommeliers" test and grade coffees on both physical and tasting factors. The Coffee Quality Institute, the issuer of Q-grading licenses, holds a repository containing thousands of coffees submitted for review. What insights can we gain from examining this data?
